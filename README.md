Robotics and Intelligent Systems Project: Monte Carlo Localization

Differential Drive Robot Localization using Particle Filter (MCL)
This project implements Monte Carlo Localization (MCL), a probabilistic algorithm used by mobile robots to estimate their position and orientation (pose) in a known map despite noisy movements and sensor readings. The simulation is entirely coded in Python using NumPy for mathematics and Matplotlib for visualization.

Getting Started

Prerequisites
The simulation requires the following Python libraries:

NumPy (for numerical operations)
Matplotlib (for visualization and plotting)
They can be installed via pip:

Bash

pip install numpy matplotlib
Running the Simulation
The project consists of a single file, mcl_localization.py. Save the complete Python code into this file and execute it from your terminal:

Bash

python mcl_localization.py
The simulation is autonomous (no screen input required) and will output a final plot comparing the actual path versus the estimated path.

Technical Overview: The Particle Filter
The Particle Filter (MCL) solves the localization problem by maintaining a set of weighted hypotheses, called particles, about the robot's true pose.

1. The Particle Cycle
The core of the algorithm iterates through a three-step cycle based on Bayesian estimation:

Prediction (Motion Update): When the robot commands a noisy movement (Forward Kinematics), all particles are moved according to the command, plus added motion noise. This simulates the robot's uncertainty.

Correction (Weight Update): The robot takes a noisy sensor measurement (e.g., distance to landmarks). The code calculates a likelihood score for each particle using a Gaussian Probability Density Function (PDF), based on how well the particle's expected measurement matches the actual measurement. Particles near the robot's true location receive higher weights.

Resampling: A new, equal-weight set of particles is generated by sampling from the current set, proportional to their weights. This eliminates low-probability hypotheses, causing the particle cloud to cluster and converge on the most likely true pose.

2. Key Models Implemented
Component	Function	Purpose
Noisy Kinematics	move_robot_noisy	Updates the ground truth robot pose and the particle poses, incorporating Gaussian noise to model imperfect actuation.
Sensor Model	sense_landmarks	Calculates true distance to known landmarks (features on the map) and adds sensor noise to generate realistic measurement data.
Estimation	get_estimate	Calculates the final estimated pose using the weighted average of all particle positions.

3. Simulation Results
The simulation provides robust evidence of filter performance:

Intermediate State Plots: Briefly show the particle cloud collapsing around the true robot marker, demonstrating the filter's rapid convergence and focus.

Final Path Comparison: A stationary plot comparing the entire history of the Ground Truth Path (the actual path) against the MCL Estimated Path (the algorithm's best guess).
