# Monte-Carlo-Localization-RIS
This project implements Monte Carlo Localization (MCL), a probabilistic algorithm used by mobile robots to estimate their position and orientation (pose) in a known map despite noisy movements and sensor readings. The simulation is entirely coded in Python using NumPy for mathematics and Matplotlib for visualization.
